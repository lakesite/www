We create fully documented APIs for your app and handle aggregating data for
reports into useful, interactive bots.  Bots may be used for Slack and other
team communication services, to consolidate reports and provide rapid response.

Examples of API and bot driven applications:

    * custom report generation, accessible via Slack/bot.
    * nightly summary of service health (vulnerabilities, availability, etc)
    * custom analytics
    * customer web inquiry and response via Slack/bot.
    * command and control APIs for decentralized services
    * setting triggers to respond to events
