The focus for 2019 is to ensure that we're not only using open source software in all our solutions, but we're deeply committed to ensuring all our products are fully open source.  

In some cases this means using the GNU GPL license, where we provide a service
that you pay for instead of the software.  In this case the risk of the service or business failing is managed by ensuring your data and the software you use is free.  In other cases we'll opt for using the MIT license.
