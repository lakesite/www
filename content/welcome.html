      <h2>I. Culture</h2>
      <p>
        We're obsessed, engaged and focused on the process that produces
        fantastic results for our clients.  We're also flexible, adaptive and
        respond to the data we see and our customer's priorities.  We're big on
        transparent communication.  We identify and resolving friction points
        between the inception of your project and getting you a continuous stream
        of quality results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every section of our welcome packet is designed to maximize satisfaction,
        achieve quality results, manage expectations and mitigate risk.  We think
        you'll love our process and the way we simplify the complexity of software
        development.

      <h2>II. Agility</h2>
      <p>
        We use LEAN, agile methods and are big believers in evidence based
        estimation, pair programming, kanban boards and many of the processes
        that naturally come from accepting <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/jtrap/the-agile-samurai">three simple truths</a>
        about software development:

        <ul>
          <li>You can't gather all the requirements up front.</li>
          <li>The requirements you do gather will change.</li>
          <li>There is always more to do than time and money will allow.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>IV. Starting your project</h2>
      <p>
         We'll gather your requirements, create user stories describing in
         simple terms a condition or situation, what you want to do, and what you
         expect to happen as a result.  We'll attribute a complexity of 1-3 points
         for each of these stories.
      </p><p>
         You'll prioritize these stories based on what's most important for your
         business and we'll start working on the highest ranked stories first. We'll
         organize a group of stories to be released at the end of an iteration.
         This iteration is called a sprint, and we'll review how many stories we
         finished.  Finished means, documented, tested and done!  We'll all review
         what worked for us, what we should change, and what we should stop doing.
      </p><p>
         We'll continue this process.  After a few iterations, we'll be able
         to use evidence based estimation to project the time it will take to
         complete the project and new requirements based on our team velocity.

      <h2>IV. Checklist</h2>
      <p>
        In general, the following steps are taken to get you from your request
        for programming services to a product launch.  In some cases the scope
        of your project may be small and we'll knock it out in a week or less.
        For anything more complex, we'll follow an iterative approach and
        deliver usable features in every sprint.

      <h2>V. What we won't do</h2>
      <p>The following are things we won't do for you.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Creative agency: If you need more front end work, design, copy,
        branding and a broader marketing strategy, we recommend <a href="http://www.duncaningram.com">d.i.</a>
        for this scope.
        </li>
        <li>24-hour support: The services we provide where you do need 24/7 support
          are handled by other companies or processes to further mitigate risk.
        </li>
      </ul>
